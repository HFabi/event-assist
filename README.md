# EventAssist

EventAssist is a fictional platform to share events with family or friends -
this can be your own birthday party, a new festival you recently discovered or the marathon you all want to attend as a group.
- Find inspiration for the next weekend from your friendsâ€™ recommendations
- Recommend events to others and invite them to join you
- Organize collaboratively where and when you all want to meet

There is one catch: Primarily, the repository serves as a practice project for a cloud native application,
the involved technologies and architectural patterns. The aforementioned features are continuously added.
